What is MenialTasks?
======================
MenialTasks is, as the name suggests, a super-simple tasklist app. It's only intended as an example for my Introduction to MVVM in Delphi session from CodeRage 7. It is the bare minimum of functionality I needed to show off a couple of key topics in MVVM, such as dealing with child Views/ViewModels, etc. 

For more info check out [my blog](http://www.malcolmgroves.com/blog/?cat=90) 

NB: Now updated for XE7 and XE8. Also uses FireUI to tailor the Views for different platforms.
